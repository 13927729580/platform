# Apinf API Design
This document contains the design overview for the Apinf Administrative API.

# Versioning
The Apinf API will change over time. As such, we will use a numbered versioning scheme. Versions will be indicated by integers, starting with **1**. Version numbers will be located in the project URL, such as:

```
https://apinf.com/api/v1/.../
```
