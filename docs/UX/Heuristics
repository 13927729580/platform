### Heuristics

- 1. Information coding
    - Perception of information is directly dependent on the mapping of data elements to visual objects (graphing techniques, color, type and meaning of symbols,
    shading, transparency, etc). This can be enhanced by using realistic characteristics/techniques or the use of additional symbols (legends, scales, drop lines, grid
    lines). Is the mapping correct? Is it appropriate for the task at hand, does it support userâ€™s perceptual capabilities?  
    Another important aspect is the use of alternative visual attributes or objects to represent information derived from the data like groups of elements in clusteredrepresentations.
