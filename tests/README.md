works on meteor localhost:3000
requires proxy setup done by admin.


gate 1 runtime: 1 min 30sec
each failing test adds either 0 or 5 seconds.

gate 2 still needs seeded admin account and proxy setup

how to run:
navigate to test folder you want to run
start script called gate_#

test creates log.html that has info on what happened.
