This product is an Incubated FIWARE Generic Enabler.  If you would like to learn about the overall Roadmap of FIWARE, please check section "Roadmap" on the FIWARE Catalogue.

**Short term (next release of the product)**
The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the short term, and incorporated in the next release of the product planned for February 2019:
- Meteor update to 1.6 or let's see how high we get
- Package updates related to Meteor update
- New "Next" UI. Redesigned more simplified user flow and UI. It's going to be great!
  
**Medium term (9 months following next release)**
The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term, typically within the subsequent release(s) generated in the next 9 months after next planned release:
- Context broker tenant management integration and feature enrichment. Deepens our FIWARE co-operation and enriches APInf Cloud solution
- Wirecloud based analytics for right time data and historical data. This enables API users to see data analytics. Now we have operational dash, which shows API performance, but nothing about actual data. This is to be user controlled feature.
- Business API Ecosystem integration, basic features. Idea is to provide tool for API owners to do basic monetization.
- Proxy 42 basic integration, new proxy alternative for API umbrella
- Better mqtt broker integration. Now you *can* have a broker but real functionality is not there
- Process improvements and other technical requirement fullfillment to be a GE instead "incubated"

**Long term (some time in the future)**
The following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution of the product even though development of these features has not yet been scheduled for a release in the near future.  Please feel free to contact us if you wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap
- True data analytics
- Improved monetization
- Continue Proxy 42 integration

Long term goals can be a bit illusive, so we keep those high level.
